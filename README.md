*J. Brehmer and K. Cranmer 2019-2020*

Experiments with flows on manifolds.

The code is strongly based on the excellent [Neural Spline Flow code base](https://github.com/bayesiains/nsf) by C. Durkan,
A. Bekasov, I. Murray, and G. Papamakarios, see [1906.04032](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04032) for their paper.
